# wandergame
A wandergame that involves OOP principles, including inheritance.

A game.py module has 4 classes: Item, Character, Enemy(Character) and Room.

The main goal for player is to find the weak spot of each enemy (by searching for different items) and beat them all.

Player can do 4 things: 

1) Go to another room by entering the position("north", "south", "east" or "west") of it relatively to current room.

2) Fight with enemy using something in the bag (he shoult type "fight" and then the name of the item in the backpack).

3) Talk by typing "talk".

4) Take an item using "take" command. There is always one item in each room at most.
